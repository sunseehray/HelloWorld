# Overview

As an aspiring software developer, I want to demonstrate what I have learned about the different programming languages commonly used today including the use of IDE and version control.

This program is a basic Hello World! program. The program displays "Hello World!" on the console. It uses Python as the programming language, Visual Studio Code as the IDE, and Git and GitHub for version control.
